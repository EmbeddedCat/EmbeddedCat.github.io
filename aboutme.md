I am an undergraduate student at the University of Piraeus in Athens in the department of IT. I want to deal mainly with embedded systems, however i'm interested in anything that has to do with low-level programming (such as compilers or operating systems). Low level programming interests me because one learns how a software can interact with a piece of hardware.
